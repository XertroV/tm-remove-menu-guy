# Remove Menu Guy

This plugin patches the menu manialink code so that the 3d scene isn't created.

This mitigates the menu PlayMap bug.

Useful if you use [menu bg chooser](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/menu-bg-chooser).

This plugin can be disabled remotely in the case that a game update breaks it.
